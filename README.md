# Telegram Trading Bot


Trading bot for algorithmic trading on a cryptocurrency exchange. My first full-fledged project, work on which is still underway...) 
At the moment the bot can:
1) Open/average/close trades. Each action is accompanied by a notification in telegram.
2) Trade in hedging mode
3) React to impulses: Notify about sudden price jumps, open transactions in accordance with the specified settings.
4) The history of trading transactions and bot settings are stored in a database (SQLite)
5) At the same time, the bot can maintain (monitor, average, close) ~15 transactions without problems. (I didn’t try more transactions because the deposit size didn’t allow it :)

   
In the long term:
1) Optimization and rewriting of the bot, depending on the improvement of your own qualifications))
1) Attach computer vision to the bot to search for support and resistance lines.
2) Transferring interaction with the bot (settings, launch) to the web. (Now everything is via telegram)
3) Optimization of interaction with the exchange via a websocket.
